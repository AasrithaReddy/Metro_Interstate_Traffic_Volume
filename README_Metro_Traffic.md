# Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Analysis

This project explores and analyzes traffic volume data on the I-94 Interstate highway. It focuses on understanding patterns in **time series data**, drawing insights based on temporal features like hour of the day, day of the week, and more.

## 📘 Description

Time series data differs from typical table or image data because each observation is **timestamped**, and the **sequence** of events over time is critical. In this project, we process and analyze such data to discover meaningful patterns in traffic volume.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name**: `Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv`
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)
- **Attributes**:
  - `date_time`: Timestamp of observation
  - `traffic_volume`: Vehicle count
  - `temp`, `weather_main`, `holiday`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if visualization included)
- Datetime handling

## 📊 Features

- Timestamp parsing and feature extraction (hour, weekday, etc.)
- Traffic volume trends by hour and day
- (Optional) Correlation with weather, holidays, or temperature

## 💡 Sample Code

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv')

# Convert 'date_time' column to datetime
df['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_time'])

# Extract features from datetime
df['hour'] = df['date_time'].dt.hour
df['dayofweek'] = df['date_time'].dt.dayofweek
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the notebook.
2. Place `Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv` in the same directory.
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the notebook cell by cell.

## 📌 Notes

- Additional exploration could include weather influence on traffic, anomaly detection, or time series forecasting.
- If you're using Google Colab, ensure the dataset is uploaded to your session or mounted from Google Drive.
